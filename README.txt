FLOATSPACE

FLOATSPACE is an interactive system that explores floating as both a visual language and a metaphor for positive freedom.
The project combines generative imagery, body-based interaction, and theoretical research to create a soft, atmospheric experience where color, light, and motion drift in response to the user.


About the Project

FLOATSPACE consists of three interconnected components:

1. Resting Mode — Soft Diffusion Blocks
A click-based generator that captures the user’s touch and expands color outward to form gentle, breathing gradients.
This mode represents the stillness of floating — a quiet, anchored form of freedom.

2. Drifting Mode — Cloud Expansion via Body Interaction
A motion-responsive environment that uses the webcam to track the user’s movement.
Cloud-like forms grow, spread, and dissipate as the body moves through space.
This mode represents the movement of floating — drifting, wandering, and responding.

3. Publication
A companion book that gathers the conceptual foundation of the project.
It includes writing on positive freedom, the psychology of floating, dream states, and cultural notions of lightness, paired with visuals generated through FLOATSPACE.


Concept

Floating is understood here not as escape, but as a way of existing lightly within the world.
By translating this idea into interaction, FLOATSPACE turns philosophical reflection into an embodied experience — a small room of drifting air, light, and presence.
